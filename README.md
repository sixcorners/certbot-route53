certbot-route53
===============

**NOTE: If you're already using Route53, you're propbably better off using [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/), which was released after this script.**

This shell script helps create [Let's Encrypt][] certificates for [AWS Route53][]. It uses [Certbot][] to automate certificate requests, and the [AWS CLI][] to automate DNS challenge record creation.

Installation and Usage
----------------------

1. Install Certbot and the AWS CLI. You can use [Homebrew][] (`brew install awscli certbot`) or [pip][] (`pip install awscli certbot`).

2. [Configure the AWS CLI][]. Your account must have permission to list and update Route53 records.

3. Download the [certbot-route53.sh][] script.

    ```sh
    mkdir my-certificates
    cd my-certificates
    curl -sL https://git.io/vylLx -o certbot-route53.sh
    chmod a+x certbot-route53.sh
    ```

4. Run the script with your (comma-separated) domain(s) and email address:

    ```sh
    sh certbot-route53.sh \
      --agree-tos \
      --manual-public-ip-logging-ok \
      --email $(git config user.email) \
      --domains jed.is,www.jed.is
    ```

5. Wait patiently (usually about two minutes) while, for each domain requested:

    - Certbot asks Let's Encrypt for a DNS validation challenge string,
    - AWS CLI asks Route53 to create a domain TXT record with the challenge value,
    - Let's Encrypt validates the TXT record and returns a certificate, and finally
    - AWS CLI asks Route53 to delete the TXT record.

6. Find your new certificate(s) in the `letsencrypt/live` directory.
